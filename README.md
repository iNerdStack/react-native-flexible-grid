## üí° Usage

### 1. Flex Grid

`FlexGrid` is designed for creating highly flexible and dynamic grid layouts, capable of two-way scrolling to accommodate content that extends beyond both the viewport's width and height. By leveraging `maxColumnRatioUnits`, `itemSizeUnit`, and smooth scrolling mechanics, `FlexGrid` facilitates precise control over the grid's arrangement, dimensions, and scrolling behavior. This makes it exceptionally suited for applications requiring a versatile grid system that can display content in both horizontally and vertically overflowed layouts with ease.

#### Use Cases:

- **Interactive Galleries**: Optimal for galleries where users can explore content through both horizontal and vertical navigation.
- **Board Layout**: Ideal for creating grid board with documents or media or files in a grid that exceeds the viewport, allowing for comprehensive exploration.
- **Complex Layouts**: Perfect for applications demanding intricate grid arrangements that go beyond simple lists, including dashboards or design portfolios.

```jsx
import { FlexGrid } from 'react-native-flexible-grid';

export default function App() {
  const data = [
    {
      imageUrl: 'https://picsum.photos/200/300?random=1',
      widthRatio: 1,
      heightRatio: 1,
      text: 'Item 1',
      id: 1,
    },
    {
      imageUrl: 'https://picsum.photos/200/300?random=2',
      widthRatio: 2,
      heightRatio: 1,
      text: 'Item 2',
      id: 2,
    },
    {
      imageUrl: 'https://picsum.photos/200/300?random=3',
      widthRatio: 2,
      heightRatio: 1,
      text: 'Item 3',
      id: 3,
    },
  ];

  const renderItem = ({ item, index }) => (
    <View style={styles.boxContainer}>
      <Image
        source={{ uri: item.imageUrl }}
        style={styles.box}
        resizeMode="cover"
      />
      <Text style={styles.text}>{item.text}</Text>
    </View>
  );

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <FlexGrid
        keyExtractor={(item) => item.id.toString()}
        maxColumnRatioUnits={60}
        itemSizeUnit={60}
        data={data}
        virtualizedBufferFactor={2}
        renderItem={renderItem}
        virtualization={true}
        showScrollIndicator={false}
        style={{ flex: 1 }}
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```

### 2. Responsive Grid

The `ResponsiveGrid` is designed for optimal responsiveness, dynamically adjusting grid items based on the container's width or a specified width within the component's style properties. Utilizing a combination of `maxItemsPerColumn` alongside item-specific `widthRatio` and `heightRatio`, it efficiently organizes content into a vertically scrollable grid. This component is ideally suited for layouts where vertical scrolling is preferred and where the grid's adaptability to varying container widths or device width is crucial.

#### Use Cases:

- **Content Feeds**: Perfect for vertically scrolling content feeds that require adaptability to different screen sizes.
- **Image Galleries**: Ideal for image galleries where images need to be displayed in a responsive, organized or uneven manner.
- **Product Listings**: Suitable for e-commerce apps needing to showcase products in a neatly arranged, responsive grid.

```jsx
import { ResponsiveGrid } from 'react-native-flexible-grid';

export default function App() {
  const data = [
    {
      imageUrl: 'https://picsum.photos/200/300?random=1',
      widthRatio: 1,
      heightRatio: 1,
      text: 'Item 1',
      id: 1,
    },
    {
      imageUrl: 'https://picsum.photos/200/300?random=2',
      widthRatio: 2,
      heightRatio: 1,
      text: 'Item 2',
      id: 2,
    },
    {
      imageUrl: 'https://picsum.photos/200/300?random=3',
      widthRatio: 2,
      heightRatio: 1,
      text: 'Item 3',
      id: 3,
    },
  ];

  const renderItem = ({ item, index }) => (
    <View style={styles.boxContainer}>
      <Image
        source={{ uri: item.imageUrl }}
        style={styles.box}
        resizeMode="cover"
      />
    </View>
  );

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <ResponsiveGrid
        keyExtractor={(item) => item.id.toString()}
        maxItemsPerColumn={3}
        data={data}
        renderItem={renderItem}
        style={{ padding: 5 }}
      />
    </View>
  );
}

      <td><code>50</code></td>
           <td><code>true</code></td>
      <td> Defines the base unit size for grid items. The actual displayed size of each item in the grid is calculated by multiplying this unit by the item's <code>widthRatio</code> and <code>heightRatio</code> </td>

      <td><code>Boolean</code></td>
      <td><code>true</code></td>
      <td><code>false</code></td>
      <td> Virtualization significantly optimizes performance by only rendering the items currently visible in the viewport, plus buffer. This reduces the number of components rendered at any given time, leading to improved frame rates and smoother scrolling experiences, especially with large data.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Disabling virtualization results in all items being rendered at once, regardless of their visibility. It can impact performance and responsiveness for larger data. This is only suitable for grids with a small number of items to render.
  </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>virtualizedBufferFactor</code></td>
      <td><code>Number</code></td>
      <td><code>2</code></td>
           <td><code>false</code></td>
      <td>Defines the buffer size for pre-loading items outside the current viewport. The buffer's actual dimensions are determined by multiplying this factor by the <code>containerHeight</code> for vertical scrolling and <code>containerWidth</code> for horizontal scrolling.
      <br/>

A higher buffer factor increases the number of items pre-loaded outside the viewport, contributing to a smoother scrolling experience as more content is ready for immediate display when scrolling. However, setting a large buffer factor can affect overall performance, especially on devices with limited resources, as it increases the number of components rendered off-screen.
<br/>

While, a lower buffer factor reduces the off-screen component count, optimizing performance and resource usage. This setting is beneficial for large data or resource-constrained environments. However, it may lead to brief moments where content needs to catch up with the user's scroll speed, momentarily displaying blank areas until new items are rendered.

</td>

<td><code>scrollEventInterval</code></td>
<td><code>Number</code></td>
<td><code>200</code></td>
<td><code>false</code></td>
<td>Defines the interval, in milliseconds, at which scroll events are processed for the purpose of recalculating visible items and buffer in a virtualized grid. By setting this prop, you can throttle the frequency of scroll event handling, optimizing performance during rapid scrolling by reducing the computational load associated with updating the list of visible items and buffer.

A lower value results in more frequent updates, offering smoother visual updates of the grid's content at the potential cost of higher computational overhead. While, a higher interval decreases the frequency of updates, potentially improving performance but with less immediate recalculation triggered by scroll actions. This is crucial for fine-tuning the performance and experience of virtualized grid.
